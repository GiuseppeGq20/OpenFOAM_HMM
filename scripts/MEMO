test with Lid driven cavity
cd /work/LEOPOLD/OpenFOAM/HPC_Benchmark/Lid_driven_cavity-3d/S

directories: 0 - unitial fields
             constant - this is where the mesh is stored
             systems - files that control simulation

             system/controlDict -  parameters of simulations , handy and to change endTime , can be changed while the simulation is running 

system/fvSolution.old   - ORIGINAL SOLUTION . when simulation is running it is l;ooking for a file system/fvSolution

system/fvSolution.fixedNORM - does not use PETSc . rename to system/fvSolution . 

example 
  p
       {
           solver          PCG;   <-- for pressure use PCG
           preconditioner  DIC;   <--  for preconditioner 
           tolerance       1e-04; 
           relTol          0;
           maxIter         3000;
       }

  hint :  instead of PCG write some garbage and simulaiton will fail and list available  options , same for preconditioner


 to run a test type:
  inside /work/LEOPOLD/OpenFOAM/HPC_Benchmark/Lid_driven_cavity-3d/S 
  type icoFoam and hit enter
for distributed memory use for example:      mpirun -np 4 icoFoam -parallel 

hint  icoFoam --help 
will print out the usage 


changing compiler:
cd /work/LEOPOLD/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v2106
vi etc/bashrc

change :
  # [WM_COMPILER] - Compiler:
   # = Gcc | Clang | Icc | Icx | Cray | Amd | Arm | Pgi | Fujitsu |
   #   Gcc<digits> | Clang<digits>
   export WM_COMPILER=Gcc  <--  change to clang


ls wmake/rules/   
this has settings for different compilers , consider modifying wmake/rules/linux64Clang/c++Opt


added printf in
/work/LEOPOLD/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v2112/src/OpenFOAM/matrices/lduMatrix/solvers/PCG
